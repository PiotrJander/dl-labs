5. should we modify for test time?
6. batch norm in conv layer
7. make number of layers easily modifiable
8. compare speed of learning and accuracy
    on plots
9. maybe put BN after relu!


now add batch norm as in the example
now on to conv layers
now use our brand new moments in conv layers


maybe test what we have
-> interesting, adding batch norm to one layer
    causes smaller accuracy
