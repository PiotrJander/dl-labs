TODO rescale to original resolution of 650
TODO visualize results
TODO add biases to convs
TODO maybe fewer transforms
TODO start training on small batch

TODO conv stride 1
TODO For conv transpose use kernel size divisible by stride, 
or (possibly better option) upsample by nearest neighbour 
and then do regular convolution
